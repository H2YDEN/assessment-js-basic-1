// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which you will gather necessary requirements, such as who is the customer, what they need, why we're building the software, and more.";
const design = "This is the third step. Here is where other teams get involved, such as the marketing team and the UX team. This step will choose what the final product will look like.";
const implementation = "This is the fourth step. This is when the coding will begin.";
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step. In this step, the programmers will test their software and will integrate it into the master branch if you're working on a certain part of a software of a large software.";
const mantain = "This is the sixth step. You will keep fixing and updating your program until the end of the software's life. You will fix bugs and follow feedback.";
